    <h2>Elon Musk responds to spying concerns in China: Trust us, we're just like TikTok</h2>
    <p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk says his company's cars would never be used for spying in China, 
      in response to reports that the country's military has banned the vehicles over such concerns.
      "There's a very strong incentive for us to be very confidential with any information," 
      the billionaire said Saturday at the China Development Forum, an annual conference organized 
      by a unit of the government's State Council. "If Tesla used cars to spy in China or anywhere, 
      we will get shut down."Just hours before he spoke, 
      Reuters and Bloomberg reported that China's military had banned Tesla vehicles from entering its complexes, 
      expressing concerns over cameras equipped onboard.
      Additionally, The Wall Street Journal reported Friday that 
      the government was restricting "military staff and employees of key state-owned companies" 
      from driving the US automaker's cars, "citing concerns that data the cars gather 
      could be a source of national security leaks."</p>

    <h2>Tesla's stock will rise 350% by 2025, analyst predicts</h2>
    <p>Tesla shares have slumped in recent weeks, losing 26% of their value 
      between a record high in late January and its closing price Friday. 
      But at least one analyst sees better times ahead — much, much better.
      Ark Invest, run by the influential Cathie Wood, expects Tesla shares to reach 
      at least $3,000 by 2025. That's a rise of more than 350% from Friday's close 
      — and more than double Ark's own $1,400 price target it set last year.
      In fact, even in the worst-case "bear" scenario, 
      Ark thinks Tesla shares have an absolute bottom of $1,500 for 2025, 
      analyst Tasha Keeney wrote in a note Friday.
      Shares of Tesla (TSLA) were up more than 6% to $697 in midday trading Monday.</p>
